# TakumoLoader

## About
TakumoLoader is a simple tool, that runs osu with devserver flag! It uses DirectX11 to render, [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) as UI and [this patcher](https://github.com/rushiiMachine/osu-patcher) to show misses in relax mode.

## How to use it?
Go to [Release page](https://github.com/takumoyoshi/takumo_loader/releases) and download `takumo_loader.exe` and `Patcher.zip`. Then extract `Patcher.zip` to your osu! folder. Run the loader, if your osu! folder isn't in LocallAppData folder go to settings and setup the loader.

## Known issues
If the loader doesn't open:
  1. Win + R
  2. `%LocalAppdata%`
  3. Find and delete `TakumoLoader` folder.
  4. Run the loader again.
